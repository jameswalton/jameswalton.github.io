A quick post to highlight a useful argument option to pass to clojure.spec.test/check.

Any options provided under the :clojure.spec.test.check/opts key will flow through test.check/quick-check.
As such this is how to limit the number of tests (in this example 50) generated by clojure.spec.test/check:

```clojure
(test/check `my-fn {:clojure.spec.test.check/opts {:num-tests 50}})
```
